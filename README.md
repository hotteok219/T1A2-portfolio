## Sitemap

![Sitemap showing the home page, about page, blog page and work page](./docs/sitemap.jpg)

The site consists of 4 pages, set up in a simple structure.

The Home page (index.html) acts as the landing page once a user arrives to the site.

Other pages include the About page (about.html), Blog page (blog.html) and Work page (work.html).

From any page, the user can navigate to the other pages using the navigation menu.
Note: The navigation appears as a sidebar for mobile and tablet viewports, and as a top navigation bar for desktop viewports.

Users can also find quick links in the footer to professional resources such as GitHub, LinkedIn and a downloadable resume (PDF).

## Common page structure

![Sitemap showing the home page, about page, blog page and work page](./docs/pagestructure.jpg)

- Header allows users to navigate back to the Home page regardless of which page they're currently on.

- Navigation bar / menu allows users to navigate to any subpage regardless of which page they're currently on.

- Footer provides quick access to name, email and professional links such as GitHub,
LinkedIn and a downloadable resume.
